          <br /><br />Disclaimer: The following text is lengthy and contains
          personal anecdotes. Feel free to skip unnecessary details.

          <br /><br />I would like to express my gratitude to the TOEFL section
          on PTT, the language board on Dcard, and numerous online experts for
          their valuable insights. Their advice made the initial preparation
          phase less daunting, and I have returned to share my self-study
          experience after temporarily concluding my TOEFL journey. Although my
          scores may not be exceptionally high, I hope that my story can be
          helpful to some of you, and I welcome any discussions or exchanges
          with fellow learners.

          <br /><br />Three years ago, during my sophomore year of university, I
          had considered taking the TOEFL. One reason was my intention to
          participate in an overseas exchange program, and another was that my
          TOEIC scores had expired since my high school days. Moreover, I
          realized that the opportunities to utilize TOEIC scores in university
          were quite limited, especially without an impressive gold certificate.

          <br /><br />However, at that time, it was merely a passing thought.

          <br /><br />During the summer break between my sophomore and junior
          years, I attended a summer program at the Hong Kong Polytechnic
          University. I made many foreign friends and it was a period in my
          university life when I frequently used English. It was another peak in
          my English proficiency after my high school years. In retrospect, I
          had plenty of time to prepare for the TOEFL, but I was simply lazy.
          Looking back now, it feels regrettable because at that time, I still
          had the intention to go on an exchange program. Eventually, I chose
          China as my destination, without requiring English proficiency scores.
          I don't regret my decision to go to China for the exchange, but I do
          feel a sense of not having given my best effort back then.

          <br /><br />However, what goes around comes around, and one must pay
          their dues.

          <br /><br />During my university years, I occasionally encountered
          foreign friends due to various exchange activities. However, I found
          that each time I engaged in conversation, the topics couldn't go deep,
          and even casual small talk was difficult. Moreover, during an
          internship, there was a moment when I was left speechless in front of
          a foreign supervisor. All these experiences made me realize that I
          needed to improve my English skills. On the one hand, it made me doubt
          my English proficiency, but on the other hand, these experiences also
          made me aware that I needed to strengthen my English.

          <br /><br />In summary, I would like to share that if you have ever
          had the desire to improve your English, seize that moment and take
          action. Often, we are afraid to act because we fear failure. But
          remember, you can only have a chance if you try. Even if the final
          score is not ideal, it doesn't mean that your past efforts were in
          vain. Any effort you put in will accumulate.

          <br /><br />Returning to the main topic...In late November 2019, I
          noticed that the application deadline for the Erasmus Master's
          Scholarship in the European Union was at the end of January 2020.
          Therefore, I needed to have my English proficiency test scores before
          the end of January, which was somewhat rushed. Here, I would like to
          express my gratitude to two of my high school classmates. Starting
          from September 2019, we had regular study sessions on Monday nights to
          practice English, and they provided a lot of encouragement and support
          during my moments of uncertainty. We touched upon English every week,
          and with their support, I decided to take the TOEFL directly through
          ETS. Once money was spent, there was no turning back, so I naturally
          had to find time to prepare.

          <br /><br />I am someone who cannot stick to a strict schedule. I used
          to make numerous plans but never completed any of them, so eventually,
          I stopped making them. My study habit is to decide the progress I want
          to achieve each day after waking up, and I record it in Excel. I can
          take as much time as I want to relax once I've completed what I
          planned for the day.

          <br /><br />The daily progress may vary from person to person. At that
          time, if I had five hours to study English, usually it would be:
          <br />- One session of reading <br />- Two sessions of listening or
          three sessions of speaking <br />- One session of writing

          <br /><br />This method of practice was comfortable for me, and it
          didn't create excessive pressure. If I had less than five hours, I
          would decide based on my mood and focus on the areas I wanted to
          practice. However, the general rule was to always practice reading and
          listening together, and speaking and writing together.

          <br /><br />Preparation Phases: Early, Middle, and Late

          <br /><br />Early Phase: <br />The goal was to familiarize myself with
          the exam and establish the direction of practice for each section. I
          spent about half a month on this phase. The reference materials I used
          were "Lun Lun's Blog," Notefull YouTube channel, and the WordGod TOEFL
          introduction (https://www.wordgod.com.tw/ClassBlock/custom/15). These
          resources were generally sufficient, but whenever I had spare time, I
          would also search for TOEFL preparation videos on YouTube to listen to
          stories and improve my listening skills.

          <br /><br />Middle Phase: <br />Once I set the direction I needed to
          focus on, I started working on it. I told myself that TOEFL was just
          an exam, and as long as I kept doing it, making corrections, doing it
          again, and repeating the process, I would eventually overcome it. This
          phase lasted approximately one month. Basically, I practiced with
          KaoManTeng's materials. The practice combinations were as mentioned
          earlier: reading + listening, speaking + writing.

          <br /><br />Late Phase: <br />This phase was closer to the test date,
          and I felt more anxious as the date approached. Therefore, I reduced
          the number of practice questions. Since I enjoy watching YouTube, I
          watched many videos, mainly from the CrashCourse channel. I highly
          recommend CrashCourse because the content is concise and often
          interesting. It overlaps to some extent with the TOEFL question format
          and is a great channel to enhance your background knowledge.

          <br /><br /><br />Reading: <br />- For reading, the main focus should
          be on practicing with high-scoring questions. It's helpful to read
          news articles in your free time from sources like CNN, BBC, Al
          Jazeera, etc. Reading itself is not difficult, but it can be tiring to
          read such a long passage in English. It's recommended to practice
          reading by going through the passages repeatedly to train your
          concentration. The reading question types are quite fixed, and you can
          find techniques through extensive practice to help you identify and
          locate answers. When I prepared for the test, I didn't spend much time
          memorizing vocabulary, and I often read articles without fully
          understanding them. Despite that, I was fortunate enough to score 27
          in the reading section. Based on my experience taking the TOEFL twice,
          I found that achieving a perfect score in reading is slightly more
          challenging. So, if you find the passages for the perfect score
          difficult to comprehend or if you're not getting high scores, don't
          get discouraged. Keep practicing, and with time, the answers will
          become clearer.

          <br /><br />In addition, I struggled with the summary question
          (Question 10) for a long time and couldn't get them all right.
          Therefore, the method I eventually adopted was to try to understand
          the paragraphs mentioned in the first nine questions. I would write
          down a brief summary of each paragraph. Even when I encountered
          uncertain options in the summary question, I could use the key phrases
          from my notes to identify the relevant paragraphs and find the
          answers.

          <br /><br /><br />Listening: <br />- Initially, listening
          comprehension can be challenging, especially if your listening skills
          are not strong. To improve listening, I found two key factors:
          expanding vocabulary and increasing sensitivity to transitional words
          and changes in tone. Since I had limited time for preparation (and was
          a bit lazy), I focused more on the second aspect—enhancing my
          sensitivity. We have learned many grammar rules and transitional words
          before high school, so with more exposure, you can start noticing
          patterns and gain a good score in listening.

          <br /><br />As for note-taking, it depends on the topic of the
          listening passage. If it is related to campuses or familiar areas, I
          usually don't take notes and prefer to concentrate on understanding.
          However, if it involves subjects like biology, astronomy, arts, etc.,
          I take notes because there are many technical terms, and I often miss
          or misunderstand some parts. Notes can help me piece together the
          answers when the questions are presented.

          <br /><br /><br />Speaking: <br />- I don't have a high score in
          speaking, but I can share my approach. As mentioned earlier, I formed
          a study group with my high school classmates, and we would discuss
          articles from the BBC's headlines. If the topics were too difficult,
          we would initially discuss them in Chinese and then attempt to
          organize our thoughts in English. The main goal was to train our
          logical thinking in English.

          <br /><br />Regarding TOEFL Speaking, there are four tasks in total.
          In the early stages when you're not familiar with the format, you can
          create templates and practice using them. Once you become familiar
          with the direction and patterns of the speaking tasks, you can discard
          the templates. This way, you can deliver more comprehensive content
          without being constrained by templates or grammar, while ensuring you
          cover all the necessary points.

          <br /><br />One small point to note is that when practicing with the
          TOEFL Speaking exercises on the computer, there is a time bar
          displayed in the middle of the screen, along with the exact remaining
          time in the top right corner. However, during the actual test, there
          won't be a time bar. So, during practice, it's better to focus on the
          countdown timer rather than relying on the time bar. In my first
          attempt, I practiced while looking at the time bar, and it made me
          feel unfamiliar during the actual test

          <br /><br /><br />Writing: <br />- For writing, the main suggestion is
          to learn how to construct a solid essay structure. It's crucial to
          master the basic outline of an essay, which includes an introduction,
          two to three body paragraphs, and a conclusion. The quality and
          quantity of content in the body paragraphs play an important role in
          determining your score. It's better to spend more time on
          brainstorming and organizing your ideas before writing the essay. This
          way, the content will be more comprehensive and logical.

          <br /><br />In terms of preparation, it's helpful to analyze and
          practice writing essays from the official TOEFL guide. Pay attention
          to the structure and arguments used in the sample essays with high
          scores. Try to understand the essence of their writing and apply it to
          your own essays. During the exam, it's important to allocate your time
          effectively for each essay. I usually spent around 10 minutes on
          brainstorming, 30 minutes on writing, and the remaining 10 minutes on
          reviewing and making minor edits. With enough practice, you can
          improve your writing skills and achieve a satisfactory score.
