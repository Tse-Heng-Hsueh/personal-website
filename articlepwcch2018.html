        <div class="articleParagraph">
          As a student majoring in accounting at a national university, the
          information I come across is often related to accounting, which
          naturally gives me a better understanding of the accounting industry.
          <br /><br />To give a brief introduction, there are four major
          accounting firm alliances globally: PwC, Deloitte, KPMG, and E&Y.
          Currently, the largest accounting firm in Taiwan is Ernst & Young
          (EY), which is part of the Deloitte alliance and operates as a member
          firm within its global network. Therefore, we often refer to Ernst &
          Young as Deloitte. Other examples include PwC Taiwan, which is
          affiliated with PricewaterhouseCoopers, KPMG Taiwan, and EY Taiwan.
          <br /><br />Internationally, it is common to use the format of
          "Alliance + Region" to refer to these firms, such as Deloitte US or
          Deloitte Taiwan. It is important to understand that communication and
          understanding are the key, and there is no right or wrong way to refer
          to them, just different conventions. <br /><br />As I am about to go
          on an exchange program at Shanghai Jiao Tong University, I applied for
          the 2018 PwC China Winter Internship Program. When applying for the
          exchange, I chose Mainland China with the intention of experiencing
          life in Shanghai and exploring the job market there. After confirming
          my acceptance to Shanghai Jiao Tong University, I started applying for
          internships. <br /><br />The application process for PwC was similar
          to that of other large companies, consisting of two main stages: an
          online test and an interview. What was unique is that I did not obtain
          internship information through the official PwC China channel. I saw
          someone reposting the information in a WeChat internship exchange
          group. Therefore, before applying, I decided to chat with that student
          to confirm the company culture and job responsibilities. He also
          helped me with a recommendation when I made the final decision to
          apply (which is somewhat similar to what is known as "referral").
          However, whether there was a referral or not did not affect the
          subsequent two stages, as I still had to go through the online test
          and interview. <br /><br />The online test consisted of five sections:
          logic, math, Chinese reading comprehension, English, and personal
          traits. After passing the online assessment, the interview was
          scheduled through phone or email. <br /><br />The online test was not
          too difficult, somewhat similar to personality tests we did in high
          school and English reading comprehension tests like the ones in
          college entrance exams. It took about 2.5 hours to complete. I
          remember needing to have a stable internet connection, as my internet
          disconnected twice during the English section, causing delays...
          <br /><br />The interview was not as challenging as I had imagined. It
          lasted approximately 20 minutes, and they asked questions based on my
          resume to understand my background. I believe the main focus was on
          assessing how well I would fit in with their team. I would like to
          mention that I applied to the newly established Innovation Services
          Department at PwC China Shanghai. As for interviews in other
          departments, such as auditing or tax, I am not quite familiar with
          their procedures. <br /><br />I hope to have the opportunity to share
          more about my life as an exchange student and intern in the future.
