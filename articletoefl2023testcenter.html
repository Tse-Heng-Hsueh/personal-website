          1. Test Center Code: STN11496A
          <br />2. Test Center Name: American International Education Foundation
          (AIEF) <br />3. Transportation: 8-minute walk from Da'an MRT Station
          <br />4. Soundproofing: Good <br />5. Hardware Facilities: Good
          <br />6. Staff Service: Good <br />7. Approximate Number of Test
          Takers/Seats: 9 test takers divided into 3 small classrooms (3 test
          takers per room) <br />8. Overall Evaluation: Better than expected! I
          had a great experience at this test center over two years ago. Back
          then, there were 10 test takers in one room, but this time it was
          divided into 3 rooms, which caused minimal disturbance. Overall, I
          highly recommend it!

          <br /><br />Upon arriving at AIEF, the staff immediately reminded us
          to wear masks and asked for our yellow cards or proof of triple
          COVID-19 vaccination. They also inquired about recent COVID-19
          diagnoses. Additionally, they emphasized that masks must be kept on
          throughout the test. The test center strictly follows COVID-19
          prevention measures, so students planning to take the test here should
          pay close attention to the relevant regulations or inquire in advance.

          <br /><br />After confirming the COVID-19 requirements and passports,
          the staff guided us to the waiting area, where we needed to fill out
          some basic information. It's a good idea to bring a pen, but they
          should also provide pens on-site. After completing the paperwork, the
          staff explained the test center procedures and rules, and then took
          our photos and informed us of our seat numbers. Once these steps were
          completed, the staff divided us into different groups based on
          numbers, conducted security checks with metal detectors, and then led
          us into the respective small classrooms for the test.

          <br /><br />In my case, there were three test takers in one room. We
          started with the Reading and Listening sections, took a 10-minute
          break in the waiting area (no cell phone use or access to study
          materials allowed), and then returned to our seats to complete the
          Speaking and Writing sections. After finishing the test, we filled out
          a feedback form and were free to leave the test center.

          <br /><br />One small incident I encountered was during the security
          check. The test center personnel informed us that we couldn't bring
          our own tissue paper into the test room (possibly due to packaging
          reasons), so I left my personal tissue in the waiting area. However,
          once inside the test room, a staff member proactively asked if I
          needed some tissue paper. It was a heartwarming gesture! I'm very
          grateful to the staff on that day, and I highly recommend this test
          center.

          <br /><br />Lastly, although this test center is excellent, I wish
          everyone success in conquering the TOEFL after just one visit to this
          center!
