          <br /><br /><br />[Preface]

          <br /><br />During the initial phase of preparation, I considered
          whether to attend tutoring classes. Tutoring classes have their
          advantages, such as comprehensive resources and potential networking
          opportunities for studying abroad. However, the downside is the
          additional financial cost. For students with more flexible budgets, I
          recommend trying out different tutoring classes to determine if they
          meet your needs. Personally, I felt that the online resources were
          sufficient, and I didn't want to spend too much money. Additionally, I
          realized that I am someone who can't constantly sit in a classroom and
          follow a predetermined schedule. Therefore, I decided to self-study. I
          would like to express my gratitude to my college classmate with the
          surname Ding for providing me with the physical Mason study materials,
          which allowed me to quickly grasp the preparation for reading and
          writing.

          <br /><br /><br />[Plan]

          <br /><br />Preparing for the GRE has two crucial aspects. Firstly, it
          is important to identify available resources early on and allocate
          study progress throughout the upcoming days. Secondly, it is essential
          to strictly follow the study plan while maintaining some flexibility.

          <br /><br />Understanding one's own background is vital since each
          test taker has unique circumstances. After reading several
          testimonials, it becomes possible to determine one's starting point
          and then consider the required duration for preparation and the
          necessary study materials. However, despite the differences in study
          methods, duration, and materials, there is one set of resources that
          everyone mentions, known as "real questions" or "practice materials."

          <br /><br />These practice materials are based on the experiences of
          past test takers and serve as a type of exam preparation material.
          Regardless of the number of resources available or the amount of
          material to cover, it is recommended to prioritize these practice
          materials. The way the questions are presented in these materials
          reflects the content that will be tested in the exam, and you may even
          encounter identical questions in the actual test. Understanding
          high-quality questions is far more effective than aimlessly completing
          a large number of questions!

          <br /><br /><br />[Schedule]

          <br /><br />Week 1: Monkey Brother's 112 challenging math problems,
          240 real math questions, Lin Du Xi's text completion, Mason 2000
          (1-500) <br />Week 2: Reading comprehension practice set (passages
          1-100), Mason's logic reading (1)(2), Mason 2000 (500-1000) <br />Week
          3: Reading comprehension practice set (passages 101-200), Mason's
          logic reading (3)(4), Mason 2000 (1000-1500) <br />Week 4: Text
          completion exercise set (questions 1-400), self-made vocabulary list,
          reviewed official argument questions <br />Week 5: Text completion
          exercise set (questions 410-960), self-made vocabulary list, reviewed
          official issue questions <br />Week 6: First practice test (Magoosh),
          Magoosh math (questions 1-230), Mason 2000 (1-1500) <br />Week 7:
          Second practice test (Magoosh), Magoosh math (questions 230-779),
          self-made vocabulary list <br />Week 8: Third practice test (Magoosh),
          text completion exercise set (questions 1-960), Mason 2000 (1-1500)
          <br />Week 9: Fourth practice test (PPI), reviewed text completion
          exercise set, reading comprehension (questions 1-70), reviewed math
          questions

          <br /><br />The above is a rough overview of the schedule in
          retrospect. In the initial phase, I set more content to cover each
          week, but I realized it was mentally and time-wise impossible to study
          that much. Therefore, in the later stages, I focused less on the
          quantity and aimed to become proficient in the questions I had
          completed through repeated reviews. I kept an Excel sheet to record
          what I studied and the time spent studying each day. I also set goals
          to achieve every other day. By following a structured daily routine, I
          maintained a balanced and healthy approach, neither exerting too much
          effort nor being too lax. Personally, I dedicated an average of six
          hours per day to GRE preparation, with the rest of the time spent on
          other activities. I allocated 2.5 hours in the morning, 2.5 hours in
          the afternoon, and 1 hour after a full meal, which allowed me to cover
          the listed study materials and review the practice sets 2-3 times.

          <br /><br /><br />[Closing Remarks]

          <br /><br />Thank you for reading until the end. I unintentionally
          wrote so much, and I hope that some parts of it can be helpful to you!
          I would like to share a quote I really like: "Just because it hasn’t
          happened yet, doesn’t mean it’s not gonna happen." Believe in yourself
          and persistently pursue your goals.
