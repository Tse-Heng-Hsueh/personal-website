        <div class="articleParagraph">
          The application period for summer internships/part-time positions at
          the four major accounting firms in Taiwan usually starts in early
          April and ends at the end of April. The exact timing may vary each
          year, but it generally falls within this timeframe. If you are an
          accounting major and interested in applying for an internship at one
          of these firms, the accounting department of your university will
          usually share relevant information, so make sure to check your emails
          frequently. If you are not an accounting major but still want to
          apply, pay attention to the firms' websites during April, or you can
          ask your accounting major friends for assistance.<br /><br />This year
          (2018), except for Ernst & Young (EY), the other three major firms
          only opened audit internship positions to external applicants. Why do
          we say "external"? That's because there are different ways to obtain
          an internship at an accounting firm. For example, if you win
          competitions organized by these firms (e.g., EY International Tax
          Elite Competition, PwC International Tax Cup Case Analysis
          Competition), you may have a chance to secure an internship, although
          such opportunities usually focus on tax-related positions.
          Alternatively, if you have attended seminars and established friendly
          relationships with people from the firms, not necessarily high-ranking
          individuals, they might be willing to recommend you. There are
          actually many approaches, but the key is to network and inquire
          extensively. However, for regular individuals like myself, it is still
          possible to obtain an internship through open recruitment processes.

          <br /><br />Now, let's talk about Ernst & Young (EY). EY is one of the
          few firms that conduct open recruitment for interns during winter
          break, and they offer not just audit internships but also tax,
          transaction advisory, and enterprise risk management internships, both
          during winter and summer breaks. If you're interested, you can visit
          the 2018 EY Summer Internship Program website at
          https://www.ey.com/tw/zh_tw/careers/students/ey-summer-internship-program-2018.
          If the link is still active, you can find detailed qualifications for
          each department's recruitment.

          <br /><br />In summary, the qualification requirements for EY's audit,
          tax, transaction advisory, and enterprise risk management positions
          are not significantly different from those of the other three major
          firms. The requirements are as follows: you should be a third-year
          student who has completed intermediate accounting and auditing
          courses. However, these two criteria are not absolute. If you are a
          second-year or even a first-year student, I strongly recommend giving
          it a try. As long as you can prove your capabilities or demonstrate
          your dedication, it's worth a shot. Opportunities are never given if
          you don't try. Apart from the aforementioned department-specific
          positions, EY also offers a "Performance Improvement" internship that
          has higher requirements, including SQL programming skills, experience
          in macro programming development, and proficiency in English. If
          you're interested, you may consider taking relevant courses in the
          upcoming academic year.

          <br /><br />Finally, let's talk about the application process. You
          need to fill out the application forms provided by each of the four
          major firms, attach your academic transcripts from previous years, and
          send them to the designated addresses or submit them to your
          university's accounting department, depending on whether the firms
          have collaborations with accounting departments. If not, you'll need
          to send the application by yourself. Additionally, in most cases,
          interviews are not required for internships at accounting firms.

          <br /><br />As for why the title mentions PwC, it's because out of the
          four major firms, only PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) offered me an
          internship. So, I will be spending my entire summer at PwC. I used to
          wonder how I would choose if more than one firm accepted me, but as it
          turned out, I was overthinking it.

          <br /><br />Thank you!!
