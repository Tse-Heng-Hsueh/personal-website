          [English Background] GRE 328, TOEFL 101
          <br />[Preparation Time] On and off for two months, approximately 60
          hours in total <br />[Study Materials] TPO <br />[Test Center
          Information] Educational Testing Service (ETS) - STN11496A
          (Recommended! You can refer to my previous post about the test
          center.) <br />[TOEFL Scores] <br />2020.01.04 - Test 1: 87
          <br />2020.01.18 - Test 2: 96 <br />2020.11.07 - Test 3: 101
          <br />(The above scores have expired) <br />2023.05.06 - Test 4: 107
          (R28/L28/S23/W28)

          <br /><br /><br />[Motivation] <br />I am planning to apply for a
          master's degree, and since my previous TOEFL scores have expired, I
          had to take the test again.

          <br /><br /><br />[Reason for Self-study] <br />I have previously
          prepared for both the GRE and TOEFL through self-study. I am used to
          planning my study schedule according to my own pace, and it has
          yielded good results. Therefore, I chose self-study again this time.

          <br /><br /><br />[Introduction] <br />I recommend that when deciding
          to take the test, register for a reasonable test date (generally 1.5-2
          months later) to give yourself a time pressure. This will help you
          maintain a positive mindset and understand that this test is not
          endless. Having the first test result also allows you to identify
          areas that need improvement. Additionally, TOEFL is a test that can be
          taken repeatedly (although it's expensive), but it is not a
          make-or-break test. So, there is no need to be overly anxious. Keep up
          the good work!

          <br /><br /><br />[Self-study Plan] <br />Basically, I followed the
          same pattern as my previous self-study for the GRE: <br />1.
          Understand your own situation (available time, study resources).
          <br />2. Register for a test two months later. <br />3. Practice with
          one set of TPO. <br />4. Establish a flexible study plan. <br />5.
          Execute the plan.

          <br /><br />Everyone's commitment to the study plan varies. It is
          essential to know yourself well and establish a study plan that suits
          you. For example, I can study for a maximum of four hours a day;
          otherwise, I won't be motivated to study more. On weekends, I prefer
          to take breaks. So, my study rhythm is at least four hours a day, and
          at most four hours, with breaks on weekends. This plan allows me to
          study comfortably and is effective.

          <br /><br />Ultimately, it depends on how much time you have, what
          kind of person you are, and what score you need. After careful
          consideration, create a comprehensive plan for each section and
          execute it diligently. I believe you will eventually achieve your
          desired score.

          <br /><br /><br />[Reading] <br /><br />Although I had successfully
          overcome the reading section of the GRE and had taken the TOEFL
          multiple times, getting back into the serious mode of reading in
          English is still painful.

          <br /><br />My strategy is to focus on comprehension. Whenever a
          question refers to a specific paragraph, I read that entire paragraph
          directly and make simple notes on the key points. This helps me when I
          tackle the integrated questions at the end of the reading section.

          <br /><br />While reading, I remind myself not to skip around and
          instead adopt an active reading approach. I strive to understand the
          purpose of each sentence and paragraph, which allows me to grasp the
          overall structure of the passage. This method enhances my
          understanding of the content. With consistent practice of active
          reading, my reading speed naturally improves.

          <br /><br />For this preparation, I didn't practice a lot of passages.
          For me, the purpose of practice was mainly to familiarize myself with
          the rhythm and techniques of reading. The results have been good.
          There are advantages to reading fewer passages as well, such as not
          straining my eyes too much. Additionally, I supplement my reading by
          looking up any unfamiliar words I come across. It's always beneficial
          to have a better understanding of vocabulary. I suggest that if you
          have extra time, you can also spend more time learning new words, as
          each passage tends to include vocabulary-related questions.

          <br /><br /><br />[Listening] <br /><br />Listening is the section I
          practiced the most. I wanted to strengthen this skill because in my
          previous attempts, I often had a sense of partial understanding
          without truly grasping the content.

          <br /><br />The TOEFL listening questions mostly fall into categories
          such as main idea, detail, function, inference, and attitude. So,
          during practice, I approach the listening passages with these question
          types in mind. I try to ask myself these questions while listening and
          pay attention to transitional words and examples. After practicing
          several sets, I began to get a better sense of the direction.

          <br /><br />The design of TOEFL listening tasks aims to simulate
          situations we encounter in classrooms or when dealing with
          administrative matters. Therefore, I imagine myself as a participant
          in those situations. In class, we don't need to catch every single
          word, but we do need to understand the general idea of each segment
          and follow the speaker's logic to avoid dozing off.

          <br /><br />I also recommend practicing in noisy environments, rather
          than only getting accustomed to listening in quiet spaces. This
          simulates unexpected noises that can occur in the actual test
          environment. At the same time, it aligns with the concept that
          listening doesn't require understanding every single word. As long as
          you grasp the main idea, you can answer the questions. Personally, I
          mainly listen during my commute or during lunch breaks at work. You
          can try to find fragments of time to listen to recordings!

          <br /><br /><br />[Speaking] <br /><br />I have been struggling to
          improve my speaking score, and I am not sure how to practice
          effectively. It would be helpful to read insights from others who have
          achieved high scores in the speaking section.

          <br /><br />The typical logic for TOEFL speaking tasks is as follows:
          <br />Task 1: Take a stance on a given topic -> State why you support
          that side -> Provide an example.

          <br />Task 2: Summarize the passage -> Discuss the reasons the speaker
          in the conversation supports or opposes -> Conclude.

          <br />Task 3: Summarize the passage -> Discuss an example provided by
          the professor in the lecture.

          <br />Task 4: Discuss a concept and examples presented by the
          professor in the lecture.

          <br /><br />You may notice that, except for the first task, the
          speaking section is mainly about quickly extracting key points.
          Whether it's the content of the passage or the listening, the ability
          to efficiently organize key points and deliver them in a coherent and
          concise manner is crucial. Of course, pronunciation and language use
          are also factors that contribute to a higher score. You can focus on
          improving these aspects based on your own weaknesses.

          <br /><br />The templates circulating online may vary, and it's
          important for everyone to organize them according to their
          preferences. What matters most is finding a template that suits you.
          Personally, I used to struggle with speaking because I would try to
          memorize templates, leading to a stilted delivery. Sometimes, I would
          even correct myself in the middle of speaking if I realized I used the
          wrong template, which wasted time. Therefore, this time I focused on
          remembering transitional words but didn't specifically memorize
          templates. After practicing various prompts, I naturally developed a
          logical approach and a habit of using appropriate transitional
          phrases. If you're not comfortable with using speaking templates, you
          can refer to this approach.

          <br /><br /><br />[Writing] <br /><br />In terms of writing, the value
          of my experience may diminish in the future as the test undergoes
          changes starting in July. I'm simply sharing my experience for
          reference. For writing, I divided my practice into two parts:
          memorizing templates for two types of prompts and preparing commonly
          used phrases.

          <br /><br />I organized the templates in a way that was easiest for me
          to memorize and practiced them repeatedly to ensure I could
          effortlessly recall them within a given time limit (approximately 5
          minutes). As for the phrases, I applied the logical structure used in
          previous Chinese essay writing exams and memorized a few versatile
          quotes and phrases to support my ideas while also adding to the word
          count.

          <br /><br />In my understanding, TOEFL writing does not aim to test
          complex grammar usage, intricate structures, or profound personal
          opinions. Instead, it requires test takers to express their ideas in a
          simple, logical, and relevant manner. I believe that as long as you
          stay on topic, avoid mistakes in vocabulary, remember to use articles
          appropriately, and don't confuse tenses, you can achieve a good score!
          Take this as a reference.

          <br /><br /><br />[Conclusion] <br /><br />Taking the TOEFL is a
          process of experiencing progress in English. Although there may be
          anxiety and uncertainty, I wish everyone the belief in themselves and
          the perseverance to continue, as it will lead to good results!
